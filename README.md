imageUploadApi is designed to aid image uploads to an application.
Please note that this api does not take into consideration the registration, and extensively, the authentication of users. It is more like a feature rather than a full package.
When combined with a basic user authentication api, it can then be regarded as a full application.
Other files are imported from, and exported through, index files of the corresponding folders to give a more organized and clean code.
